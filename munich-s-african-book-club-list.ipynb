The goal of the club was to discuss literary works created by African authors in the 20th and 21st centuries. \n\nThe [MMAL book-club](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Meets-African-Literature/) has gone on to experience much success with up to 188 registered members participating in monthly meetings of books voted for and selected by members of the group. The group is public and anyone is free to join. \n\nThis notebook provides an exploratory data analysis based on the current list of books which have been selected for discussion. \n\n![Munich Meets African Literature](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/6/e/highres_468474382.jpeg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.81825Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.818593Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.82454Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.818561Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.823365Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## DATA LOAD","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/Munich-Meets-African-Lit.csv', delimiter=';')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.829125Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.830117Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.841598Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.830067Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.840442Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## DATA TABLE INSPECTION","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.846654Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.848392Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.867335Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.848353Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.866295Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.tail(5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.869342Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.869866Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.891703Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.869824Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-01T09:13:01.890725Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## COUNTRIES\n\n#### The main selection criteria for a book is the nationality of the author.
